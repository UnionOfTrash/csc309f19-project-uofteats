## Project Overview

UofTEats is a website for university students to order their food served by food trucks online. Similar to the interface of UberEats, each food truck has its own spot on UofTEats where students can get an intuitive view to all available food trucks. By clicking each truckâ€™s view, students can order any food they want from the menu of the specific food truck and set a time to take the order from the truck.

This website is intended not only to solve the issue that students have to suffer from the extremely hot/cold weather while waiting for the order to be ready, but also save their time by ordering their lunch/dinner before the lecture is finished.
